## Functionality

Create a simple JavaFX window that allows users to choose one of 
two selections from a drop-down menu, then select or delete them.
The selections and deletions should be shown in a messages text area
displaying what option was selected or deleted.

## Files

### app.java

Creates stage, scene, containers, buttons, and text area. Responsible
for the functionality of the buttons, as well as appending the text area.

### Deployment Instructions

I used IntelliJ Community Edition to write the code for this project. In order
to deploy it locally on your machine. You will first need to pull the files from git,
then run the "mvnw" shell script to build the maven project.
